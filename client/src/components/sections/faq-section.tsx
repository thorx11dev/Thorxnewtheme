const allFaqData = [
  {
    id: "001",
    protocol: "PLATFORM-OVERVIEW",
    question: "What is THORX?",
    answer: "THORX is an AI-powered digital engagement platform that connects businesses with verified human attention while enabling users to earn TX-Points through meaningful online activities. Our three-engine architecture: Engine A (Attention Marketplace), Engine B (AI-Driven CPA Offers), and Engine C (Guild Social Hub) — all backed by multi-layer AI fraud prevention."
  },
  {
    id: "002",
    protocol: "EARNING-MODEL",
    question: "How do I earn TX-Points on THORX?",
    answer: "Three earning streams: 1) Engine A — Watch 15–25 second video ads then actively explore the advertiser's page for 15 seconds inside our AI sandbox. 2) Engine B — Complete curated CPA tasks (app downloads, reviews, registrations) with AI-verified proof submission. 3) Engine C — Join a Guild to earn bonus TX-Points from weekly tasks and vault multipliers, plus earn direct referral commissions."
  },
  {
    id: "003",
    protocol: "POINTS-SYSTEM",
    question: "What are TX-Points and how do they work?",
    answer: "TX-Points are THORX's universal earning unit — they represent your real value on the platform without exposing raw currency figures. Every ad view, task completion, and referral commission is credited as TX-Points in real time. When you're ready to cash out, you enter the Conversion Room to convert TX-Points into real PKR, which is then sent to your JazzCash or EasyPaisa account."
  },
  {
    id: "004",
    protocol: "CONVERSION-ROOM",
    question: "How do I convert TX-Points to real money?",
    answer: "Navigate to the Payout section and enter the Conversion Room. You'll see exactly how many TX-Points you hold and the current conversion rate to PKR. Select an amount to convert, review the platform fee (deducted in TX-Points based on your rank), confirm — and your PKR balance is queued for transfer to JazzCash or EasyPaisa. This is the only screen where PKR amounts are shown."
  },
  {
    id: "005",
    protocol: "ENGINE-C",
    question: "What is Engine C — the Guild Social Hub?",
    answer: "Engine C is THORX's social gaming hub. It has two spaces: 1) The Public Space (open to all) — browse guild profiles, rankings, and performance boards, then send a recruitment request to join one. 2) The Private Member Dashboard — exclusive to guild members: real-time team chat, weekly task panels with bonus TX-Point rewards, a live vault viewer, and guild roster with contribution stats."
  },
  {
    id: "006",
    protocol: "GUILD-VAULT",
    question: "How does the Guild Vault work?",
    answer: "When you earn TX-Points while a Guild member, 15% is automatically held in your Guild Vault escrow. At the end of each week, if your Guild hits its collective point target, those held points are released with a rank-based multiplier (up to 1.30× at Guild Rank S). If the target is missed, the held points roll over with a partial release. The Vault incentivizes coordinated teamwork."
  },
  {
    id: "007",
    protocol: "WEEKLY-TASKS",
    question: "What are Weekly Tasks?",
    answer: "Weekly Tasks are exclusive high-reward missions available only to active Guild members in Engine C. Each week, a fresh set of tasks appears in your Member Dashboard. Completing them earns bonus TX-Points credited directly to your wallet, separate from your ad or referral earnings. Solo users (not in any Guild) cannot access Weekly Tasks — another strong incentive to join one."
  },
  {
    id: "008",
    protocol: "REFERRAL-SYSTEM",
    question: "How does the Referral Commission work?",
    answer: "THORX operates a direct (single-level) referral system. Share your referral link — when someone registers and converts their TX-Points, you receive 15% of their platform fee as TX-Points credited to your wallet instantly. It's simple, transparent, and scales with how active your referred users are. There are no multi-level tiers or hidden splits."
  },
  {
    id: "009",
    protocol: "RANKING-SYSTEM",
    question: "What are the user ranks and how do they work?",
    answer: "THORX has five personal ranks: Nawa Aya (E) → Chota Don (D) → Bawa Ji (C) → Haji Sab (B) → Chacha Supreme (A/S). Ranks unlock lower platform fees at conversion, faster payout priority, and higher Guild Vault release multipliers. Guild Ranks (E through S) are separate — they track your Guild's collective weekly performance."
  },
  {
    id: "010",
    protocol: "PAYOUT-METHODS",
    question: "How do I withdraw my earnings?",
    answer: "Access is always open in the Payout section — no daily task completion required. Enter the Conversion Room, convert the TX-Points you want, then select JazzCash or EasyPaisa and enter your account details. Higher-ranked users (Chacha Supreme, Haji Sab) have their payouts processed first. The minimum conversion threshold is shown in your Wallet section."
  },
  {
    id: "011",
    protocol: "ATTENTION-REQUIREMENT",
    question: "What does 'Turn Attention into Currency' mean?",
    answer: "THORX's hidden AI Attention Detector tracks three real behavioral signals: Tab Visibility (pauses if you switch tabs), Micro-Movement Delta (detects cursor or touch activity), and Scroll Vector (confirms you've scrolled at least 10–20% of the page). All three must pass before TX-Points are credited. Genuine attention is the product — no shortcuts allowed."
  },
  {
    id: "012",
    protocol: "HALAL-ECOSYSTEM",
    question: "Is THORX earning Halal?",
    answer: "Yes. THORX operates within a strict halal-based earning model. All video advertisements and CPA offers undergo content filtering — no haram or inappropriate material is promoted. Earnings are based on genuine work (verified human attention and engagement), not passive income, interest, or gambling. TX-Points are earned, not speculated."
  },
  {
    id: "013",
    protocol: "ENGINE-A",
    question: "What is Engine A — the Attention Marketplace?",
    answer: "Engine A is the core earning engine. Phase 1: You watch a 15–25 second video ad via our Waterfall Video Player (if one ad network is empty, the next loads instantly). Phase 2: The advertiser's landing page loads inside a secure THORX sandbox. You must actively explore it for 15 seconds. A hidden AI behavioral tracker verifies genuine attention before crediting TX-Points."
  },
  {
    id: "014",
    protocol: "ENGINE-B",
    question: "What is Engine B — AI-Driven CPA Offers?",
    answer: "Engine B is the high-yield task system. The THORX team curates reliable offers from top CPA networks (app downloads, reviews, registrations). You complete the task and upload proof. Our AI Agent runs a multi-tier fraud check: metadata/hash duplicate detection, OCR + LLM screenshot verification, and escrow release — ensuring fair, fast TX-Points for real work."
  },
  {
    id: "015",
    protocol: "SECURITY",
    question: "Is THORX secure and my data safe?",
    answer: "Yes. THORX uses secure session-based authentication, encrypted data handling, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and AI-powered fraud prevention on every interaction. The platform is web-first by design — no app download needed — which allows immediate security patches to be deployed without app store delays. Your account data is never sold or shared."
