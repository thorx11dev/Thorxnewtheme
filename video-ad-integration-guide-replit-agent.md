# Complete Guide: Integrating Video Ad Networks with THORX Using Replit Agent

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-06  
**Your Website:** THORX (Full-stack React/Express earning platform)  
**Current Stack:** React, Vite, Express, PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS

---

## üìã WHAT YOU NEED BEFORE STARTING

### 1. **Choose Your Video Ad Network**

Based on the research report, you need to decide:

**Option A: Starting Small (No Traffic Requirements)**
- **Network:** Aniview
- **Best for:** New publishers, no minimum traffic
- **Next step:** Sign up at https://aniview.com

**Option B: Established Publisher (500K+ pageviews OR $2K+ revenue)**
- **Network:** Publift
- **Best for:** Maximum revenue potential
- **Next step:** Apply at https://www.publift.com/contact

**My Recommendation:** Start with Aniview, then migrate to Publift when you hit 400K pageviews.

### 2. **Get Your API Credentials**

After signing up with your chosen network, you'll receive:

**For Aniview:**
- ‚úÖ Publisher ID (e.g., `pub_12345`)
- ‚úÖ Channel ID (e.g., `ch_67890`)
- ‚úÖ API Key (optional, for reporting)

**For Publift:**
- ‚úÖ Fuse Tag ID (provided after website audit)
- ‚úÖ Account Manager contact info

**For Generic VAST Integration:**
- ‚úÖ VAST Tag URL (e.g., `https://ads.network.com/vast?...`)

### 3. **Decide Where Ads Will Appear**

Think about:
- [ ] Do you have video content on your site? (If yes, use in-stream ads)
- [ ] Want ads between content sections? (Use outstream/native video ads)
- [ ] Which pages? (Home, dashboard, earning pages, etc.)
- [ ] How many ads per page? (Recommendation: 1-3 max)

## ü§ñ HOW TO WORK WITH REPLIT AGENT (Step-by-Step)

### PHASE 1: PREPARATION (Before Talking to Agent)

**Step 1:** Sign up with your chosen ad network and get credentials  
**Step 2:** Decide ad placement locations on your site  
**Step 3:** Have your credentials ready (DO NOT share them in chat yet)

### PHASE 2: INITIAL REQUEST (Your First Message to Agent)

**‚úÖ GOOD Example Message:**

```
I want to integrate Aniview video ads into my THORX website. I need:

1. Add video ad slots on the homepage (below hero section)
2. Add ads on the dashboard page (between earning methods)
3. Use React components that work with our existing Vite setup
4. Store API credentials securely as environment variables
5. Track ad performance in our analytics

I have my Aniview Publisher ID and Channel ID ready.
```

**‚ùå BAD Example Message:**

```
Add ads to my site
```
*(Too vague - agent needs specifics)*

### PHASE 3: PROVIDING CREDENTIALS (When Agent Asks)

The agent will ask for your API credentials. Here's how to provide them:

**‚úÖ CORRECT Way - Use Replit Secrets:**

1. **Wait for agent to use the `ask_secrets` tool** - The agent will automatically prompt you through the Replit UI
2. **You'll see a secrets input form** appear in the interface
3. **Enter your credentials** in the secure form (they won't appear in chat)

**Example - What agent will ask for:**
- `ANIVIEW_PUBLISHER_ID`
- `ANIVIEW_CHANNEL_ID`
- `ANIVIEW_API_KEY` (optional)

**‚ùå WRONG Way - Never Do This:**

```
My publisher ID is pub_12345 and my channel ID is ch_67890
```
*(Never paste API keys directly in chat - security risk!)*

### PHASE 4: INTEGRATION STEPS (What Agent Will Do)

The agent will automatically:

**Step 1: Code Integration**
- ‚úÖ Create React components for video ads
- ‚úÖ Add ad initialization logic
- ‚úÖ Import required libraries (Video.js, IMA SDK, or network-specific SDK)
- ‚úÖ Configure ad slots with your placement preferences

**Step 2: Environment Setup**
- ‚úÖ Store your credentials in Replit Secrets (secure environment variables)
- ‚úÖ Configure access to secrets in frontend/backend
- ‚úÖ Add necessary npm packages

**Step 3: UI Integration**
- ‚úÖ Add ad components to your specified pages
- ‚úÖ Style ads to match THORX design (industrial/cinematic theme)
- ‚úÖ Ensure responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Step 4: Testing**
- ‚úÖ Load test ads to verify integration
- ‚úÖ Check error handling and fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Test across different devices/browsers

### PHASE 5: REVIEW & FEEDBACK

**What to Check:**

1. **Visual Review:**
   - Do ads appear in the right locations?
   - Do they match your site's design?
   - Are they responsive on mobile?

2. **Functional Review:**
   - Do ads load within 5 seconds?
   - Does video content still play if ads fail?
   - Can users skip ads (if enabled)?

3. **Performance Review:**
   - Is page load time acceptable? (Check Lighthouse score)
   - Are there any console errors?

**How to Give Feedback to Agent:**

**‚úÖ GOOD Feedback:**
```
The ads are working but I need adjustments:
1. Move the homepage ad below the "Trust Builder" section instead
2. Reduce ad size on mobile from 640px to 100% width
3. Change skip button from 5 seconds to 6 seconds
```

**‚ùå VAGUE Feedback:**
```
Ads don't look right, fix them
```

### PHASE 6: COMPLIANCE & PRIVACY (Agent Will Handle)

The agent will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Update privacy policy with ad disclosure
- ‚úÖ Add cookie consent for ad tracking (GDPR/CCPA)
- ‚úÖ Configure "Do Not Sell My Info" for California users
- ‚úÖ Add ad preference toggles if needed

**What Agent Needs from You:**
- Confirm your target audience regions (US, EU, global?)
- Approve privacy policy changes

## üí¨ COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Basic Integration Request

```
I want to integrate [NETWORK_NAME] video ads into THORX.

I want to migrate from Aniview to Publift. My traffic now qualifies for Publift (500K+ pageviews).

**Current Setup:**
- Using Aniview on homepage and dashboard
- 2 ad slots currently active
- All credentials stored in Replit Secrets

**New Setup:**

## üîê SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### DO's ‚úÖ

1. **Always use Replit Secrets** for API keys
   - Agent will use `ask_secrets` tool
   - You'll enter keys in secure UI form
   - Keys are encrypted at rest

2. **Review code changes** before approving
   - Agent will show you what files are modified
   - Check that no keys are hardcoded

3. **Test in development first**
   - Agent will use dev environment
   - Verify everything works before publishing

### DON'Ts ‚ùå

1. **Never paste API keys in chat**
   - Even if you trust the agent
   - Even in "private" messages
   - Keys could leak in logs

2. **Don't skip the review step**
   - Always check privacy policy updates
   - Review ad placement locations
   - Test on multiple devices

3. **Don't use production database for testing**
   - Agent uses dev database by default
   - This protects your real user data
