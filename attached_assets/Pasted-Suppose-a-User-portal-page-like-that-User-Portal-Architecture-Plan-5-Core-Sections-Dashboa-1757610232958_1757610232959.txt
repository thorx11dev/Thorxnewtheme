Suppose a User portal page like that:

üéØ User Portal Architecture Plan
5 Core Sections:
Dashboard - User stats, earnings overview, progress tracking
Work - Ad viewing, task completion, earning activities
Referrals(Multi layer) - Referral management, code sharing, referral stats
Payout - Withdrawal requests, payment history, balance management
Help - Support, FAQ, documentation, contact

Navigation System (Like Landing Page):

üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Experience:

Arrow Key Navigation - Left/Right arrows to navigate between sections
Visual Navigation Elements - Progress dots, section indicators
Cinematic Transitions - Smooth scaling and opacity animations between sections
Full-screen sections - Each section takes full viewport height

üì± Mobile Experience:

Touch/Swipe Navigation - Swipe between sections like pages
Navigation Arrows - Tap arrows to move between sections
Section Indicators - Visual dots showing current section
Responsive Layout - Each section optimized for mobile viewing
Key Technical Requirements:
Maintain 100% Functionality:

All existing Dashboard features (charts, stats, earnings)
Complete Work Center functionality (ad watching, progress tracking)
Full Referrals system (code management, referral tracking)
Payout system (withdrawal requests, history)
Help system (support, documentation)
Landing Page Navigation System:

Reuse the cinematic section CSS classes
Implement arrow key event listeners
Add visual progress indicators
Smooth transitions between sections
Responsive Design:

Desktop: Keyboard navigation + mouse interaction
Mobile: Touch navigation + visual controls
Consistent THORX industrial theme across all sections
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this User Portal? I can start by:

Creating the main User Portal page structure
Converting existing Dashboard and Work pages into sections
Building the Referrals, Payout, and Help sections
Implementing the navigation system
This will create a seamless, cinematic user experience that matches the THORX brand while providing all the functionality users need in one cohesive interface.
