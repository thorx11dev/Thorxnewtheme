Suppose a User portal page like that:

🎯 User Portal Architecture Plan
5 Core Sections:
Dashboard - User stats, earnings overview, progress tracking
Work - Ad viewing, task completion, earning activities
Referrals(Multi layer) - Referral management, code sharing, referral stats

Help - Support, FAQ, documentation, contact

Navigation System (Like Landing Page):

🖥️ Desktop Experience:

Arrow Key Navigation - Left/Right arrows to navigate between sections
Visual Navigation Elements - Progress dots, section indicators
Cinematic Transitions - Smooth scaling and opacity animations between sections
Full-screen sections - Each section takes full viewport height

📱 Mobile Experience:

Landing Page Navigation System:

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this User Portal? I can start by:

Creating the main User Portal page structure
Converting existing Dashboard and Work pages into sections
Building the Referrals, Payout, and Help sections
Implementing the navigation system
This will create a seamless, cinematic user experience that matches the THORX brand while providing all the functionality users need in one cohesive interface.
