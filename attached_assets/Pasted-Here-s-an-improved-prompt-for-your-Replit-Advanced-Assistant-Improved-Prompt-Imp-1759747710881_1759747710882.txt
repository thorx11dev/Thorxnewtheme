Here's an improved prompt for your Replit Advanced Assistant:

**Improved Prompt:**

"Implement an autoplay feature for the video ad player in the Work section with player controls.

**Autoplay functionality:**
1. Add a toggle switch that enables/disables autoplay mode
2. When enabled: automatically play the next ad when current ad completes successfully
3. Autoplay continues until user manually disables it or no ads remain
4. Credit rewards still process normally after each ad completion
5. Autoplay respects user actions (pause, stop, or toggle off)

**Player controls to add:**
- **Autoplay toggle:** ON/OFF switch
- **Minimize/Maximize:** Button to collapse/expand player
- **Volume control:** Slider (0-100%) with mute button

**Design specifications:**
- **Style:** Match existing Thorx design system
  - Colors: Orange (#FF6B35), black (#000000), beige (#E8DCC4)
  - Border style: 2-3px solid black borders
  - Typography: Existing font stack
- **Layout:** Control bar positioned at bottom or top of video player
- **Icons:** Use minimal, line-based icons consistent with current UI
- **Responsive:** Works on both mobile (touch-friendly) and desktop (hover states)

**Technical requirements:**
- Don't autoplay on page load (user must explicitly enable)
- Persist autoplay preference in session state (not localStorage)
- Handle edge cases: network errors, no more ads, user navigates away
- Ensure controls don't obstruct video content
- Maintain existing ad tracking and credit systems

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Autoplay toggles on/off correctly
- [ ] Next ad loads after current completes
- [ ] Volume persists between ads
- [ ] Minimize/maximize doesn't break video
- [ ] Credits still award properly
- [ ] Works on mobile touch and desktop click
- [ ] Accessible via keyboard navigation"

## What I Changed and Why:

### 1. **Specified exact location**
   - **Before:** "each video player"
   - **After:** "video ad player in the Work section"
   - **Why:** Based on previous images, the Work section contains ad viewing functionality. "Each video player" is vague—this clarifies the specific component.

### 2. **Broke down complex requirements**
   - **Before:** Single paragraph mixing multiple features
   - **After:** Separate sections for Autoplay, Controls, Design, Technical, and Testing
   - **Why:** Easier for AI to parse and implement systematically without missing requirements.

### 3. **Clarified autoplay behavior**
   - **Before:** "continues until the user chooses to stop"
   - **After:** "continues until user manually disables it or no ads remain" + "Autoplay respects user actions"
   - **Why:** Defines what "stop" means (disable toggle, pause, or run out of ads) and clarifies user always has control.

### 4. **Separated control types**
   - **Before:** "toggle switch button that includes the options to minimize/maximize and adjust the volume"
   - **After:** Three distinct controls listed separately
   - **Why:** The original was confusing—it sounded like one toggle controls everything. Now it's clear these are three separate UI elements.

### 5. **Made design specs concrete**
   - **Before:** "following the Thorx theme standards"
   - **After:** Exact hex codes, border styles, typography references
   - **Why:** "Theme standards" is abstract. Providing actual colors from the existing UI ensures consistency.

### 6. **Added critical technical constraint**
   - **Added:** "Don't autoplay on page load (user must explicitly enable)"
   - **Why:** Auto-playing ads on page load is terrible UX and often violates browser policies. This prevents a common implementation mistake.

### 7. **Specified state management approach**
   - **Added:** "Persist autoplay preference in session state (not localStorage)"
   - **Why:** Based on earlier guidance about localStorage not being supported in Claude artifacts, this ensures the right approach.

### 8. **Addressed credit system concern**
   - **Before:** "The credits for each ad completion do not affect this process"
   - **After:** "Credit rewards still process normally after each ad completion" + "Maintain existing ad tracking and credit systems"
   - **Why:** Original phrasing was confusing (sounded like credits are disabled). Clarified that credits still work—autoplay doesn't bypass them.

### 9. **Added accessibility requirement**
   - **Added:** "Accessible via keyboard navigation"
   - **Why:** Professional applications need keyboard accessibility. This wasn't mentioned but is essential.

### 10. **Included testing checklist**
   - **Added:** Complete testing section
   - **Why:** Ensures AI validates the implementation works correctly across all scenarios before considering it complete.

### 11. **Defined edge cases**
   - **Added:** "Handle edge cases: network errors, no more ads, user navigates away"
   - **Why:** Prevents common bugs where autoplay breaks in unusual situations.

### 12. **Clarified responsive requirements**
   - **Before:** "for both mobile and desktop"
   - **After:** "touch-friendly" for mobile, "hover states" for desktop
   - **Why:** Specifies what responsive actually means in terms of interaction patterns.

### 13. **Made positioning decision explicit**
   - **Added:** "Control bar positioned at bottom or top of video player"
   - **Why:** Gives AI a concrete layout decision instead of leaving placement ambiguous.

This rewritten prompt provides a complete implementation specification with clear requirements, technical constraints, design guidelines, and validation criteria—ensuring the AI builds a functional, polished feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing application.
