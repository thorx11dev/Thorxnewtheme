You are an expert product engineer / integration specialist. Task: research and recommend the **best video ad network(s)** to integrate into our website, then produce a complete, developer-ready integration package.

GOALS
1. Identify the top video ad network(s) that **match all constraints** (see Constraints).
2. Produce a ranked recommendation with a transparent scoring matrix and rationale.
3. Deliver a complete, step-by-step integration guide (developer-ready), test plan, legal/terms guidance and an executive summary for stakeholders.

CONSTRAINTS (must be explicitly checked & documented)
- **No traffic limits** (or clearly documented limits and realistic mitigation strategy).
- **High payout** potential; clearly show typical CPM/CPV ranges and how payout is calculated.
- **Strict content restrictions**: NO 18+, explicit sexual content, illegal content, or betting/gambling ads allowed. Verify network ad policies and provide evidence.
- **Easy to configure & integrate**: provide SDKs, sample API calls, and code snippets.
- **Full API coverage** for required operations (ad requests, reporting, fraud detection, blocking/whitelisting, revenue reports).
- **Comprehensive docs** and developer support channels (docs links, SDK repos, integration guides, support/contact info).
- **Compliance**: state support for GDPR, CCPA, COPPA where applicable.
- **Payment & legal**: show payout methods, thresholds, hold periods, tax/docs, and provide sample T&Cs or contract language for website integration.
- **No shady practices**: require verification of ad quality, anti-fraud measures, and an ad review process.

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES (produce all items exactly as requested)
1. **Executive Summary (1 page)**: top recommended network (single best choice) with one-sentence reason and final recommendation date (YYYY-MM-DD).
2. **Top 3 ranked networks**: table comparing them across key dimensions (see Scoring). Each row must include:
   - Company name
   - Official website
   - Short summary (2–3 lines)
   - Evidence of no illicit/adult/betting inventory (link to policy page or statement)
   - Traffic limits or confirmation of “no traffic cap”
   - Typical payout ranges (CPM/CPV) with source
   - Supported video formats (VAST, VPAID, outstream, instream, rewarded, etc.)
   - SDKs & API links
   - Payment methods & payout terms
   - Contact / sales / dev support links
3. **Scoring matrix & methodology**: weighted scores (example weights included below). Show per-network scores and raw data used to compute them.
4. **Complete Step-by-Step Integration Guide** (developer-ready):
   - Pre-integration checklist (privacy, legal, tags to add to site)
   - Code examples: vanilla HTML/JS + one React example + Video.js example (or explain if network requires specific player).
   - SDK install commands, sample API requests, event handlers, ad lifecycle flow, and sample error handling.
   - Header-bidding / programmatic notes (if supported), and how to configure fallbacks.
5. **Testing & QA checklist**:
   - Test pages, sample ad request payloads, network responses to validate.
   - Performance/latency checks, monitoring metrics to watch, and how to measure eCPM.
6. **Security & Fraud Mitigation**: recommended settings and third-party checks to avoid malvertising.
7. **Privacy/Compliance mapping**: how to implement consent (CMP), what disclosures to add, and sample privacy wording.
8. **Legal/T&C snippets**: suggested integration terms, privacy text, and a short clause for ad network contract addressing content restrictions.
9. **Rollout plan**: phased rollout steps (dev → staging → limited live → full), rollback criteria, and a launch checklist.
10. **Machine-readable summary**: JSON file containing each network’s key metadata (name, url, sdk_urls[], api_endpoints[], payout_terms, contact, date_checked).
11. **Sources & evidence**: links (with access date) to primary documentation pages, policy pages, payout pages, and SDK repos used to verify claims.

SCORING (example; adjust if needed)
- Monetization / Payout Potential: 30%
- Traffic limits & Scalability: 20%
- Integration complexity (SDKs/APIs/docs): 15%
- Content controls & ad quality: 15%
- Compliance & legal readiness (GDPR/CCPA/COPPA): 10%
- Support & reliability: 10%

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict)
- Main deliverable = single Markdown file with the Executive Summary at top.
- Include: comparison table (Markdown), scoring matrix (CSV or Markdown table), and JSON block at the end named `networks_summary.json`.
- Include inline code blocks for all code snippets. Each network section must end with a `Sources` sublist of URLs and the `Date checked: YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Provide a 1-page PDF/attachment with the executive summary and the JSON file as downloadable artifacts if possible.

SEARCH & VERIFICATION RULES
- Use primary sources only (official docs, SDK repos, policy pages, payouts pages). Avoid blog claims unless corroborated by official docs.
- For any claim (e.g., “no traffic limits” or “pays $X CPM”), include the link and the exact quote or screenshot reference and the date checked.
- If a network fails any hard constraint (e.g., allows gambling or adult content), exclude it and explain why.

ASSUMPTIONS
- Assume the website is a general-audience property serving global traffic. If a recommended network has geo limitations, state them clearly.
- If additional website details (stack, player, region) would materially change recommendations, explain how in the “Assumptions & open questions” section, but proceed with the research under the global-traffic assumption.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (what "done" looks like)
- I receive the Markdown report with all 11 deliverables above, the JSON summary, and working code snippets that I can drop into a test page.
- Each top-network claim has at least one primary-source URL and a date-checked stamp.
- The chosen best network meets **all** hard constraints or a short, explicit trade-off justification is provided if no perfect match exists.

FINAL NOTE
- If you encounter networks that are strong but violate the content constraints (adult/gambling), list them separately under “Excluded — Policy Violations” with clear reasons and links.

Start the research and produce the Markdown report and the JSON summary in this run.
