Here's an improved prompt for your Replit Advanced Assistant:

---

**Improved Prompt:**

"Implement an autoplay feature for the video ad player with a toggle control matching the provided design reference.

**Functionality requirements:**

1. **Autoplay behavior:**
   - When enabled, automatically start the next available ad immediately after the current ad completes successfully
   - Continue sequential playback until the user disables the toggle or the ad queue is exhausted
   - Award credits for each completed ad (autoplay does not bypass credit distribution)
   - Persist autoplay state during the current session (reset on page reload)
   - Handle interruptions gracefully: if user navigates away or closes player, reset autoplay on return

2. **Toggle control placement:**
   - Position next to existing player controls: minimize/maximize and volume/mute buttons
   - Maintain consistent spacing with other control buttons
   - Ensure visibility in both expanded and minimized player states

3. **Design specifications (reference: provided image):**
   - **Style:** Pill-shaped toggle switch with circular thumb
   - **Active state (ON):** Green background (#4CD964 or similar from Thorx palette), white thumb positioned right
   - **Inactive state (OFF):** Gray/white background, white/gray thumb positioned left
   - **Dimensions:** Match other control buttons (approximately 40-48px width, 20-24px height for toggle track)
   - **Border:** Subtle gray border (1-2px) matching the reference image
   - **Animation:** Smooth 200-300ms transition when toggling
   - **Mobile touch target:** Minimum 44x44px tappable area

4. **Theme integration:**
   - Use Thorx color variables from your existing CSS/design system
   - If green isn't in the current palette, use orange (#FF6B35) for active state
   - Maintain 2-3px black borders on control container if that's the site standard
   - Ensure adequate contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)

5. **Technical implementation:**
   - Component: Add toggle to video player controls component
   - State management: Track autoplay status (boolean)
   - Event handling: Listen for ad completion events, trigger next ad when autoplay is enabled
   - Responsive: Implement for both mobile (touch) and desktop (click) interactions

**Edge cases to handle:**
- Ad fails to load → skip to next ad or disable autoplay with user notification
- No more ads available → disable autoplay and show completion message
- User manually starts different ad → maintain autoplay state for subsequent ads
- Player closed/minimized → pause autoplay queue, resume when reopened

**Files likely affected:**
- VideoPlayer component (React/Vue/vanilla JS)
- Player controls stylesheet
- Ad queue manager/service
- Autoplay state management

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Toggle switches smoothly between states with proper animation
- [ ] Green active state matches reference image design
- [ ] Autoplay queues and plays ads sequentially when enabled
- [ ] Credits are awarded correctly for each ad
- [ ] Toggle is accessible and functional on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Edge cases handled without breaking player functionality
- [ ] Visual design matches provided reference image"

## What I Changed and Why:

### 1. **Added specific design reference acknowledgment**
   - **Before:** "the design of toggle button must be according to the images i provide"
   - **After:** "Design specifications (reference: provided image)" with detailed breakdown
   - **Why:** Acknowledging the reference image upfront, then extracting specific design elements (pill shape, green active state, circular thumb) gives the AI concrete specifications to implement.

### 2. **Described the visual design from the image**
   - **Added:** "Pill-shaped toggle switch with circular thumb," color specs, dimensions
   - **Why:** The image shows a modern iOS-style toggle. Describing its characteristics ensures the AI recreates this specific style rather than a generic checkbox or button.

### 3. **Provided color fallback strategy**
   - **Added:** "If green isn't in the current palette, use orange (#FF6B35) for active state"
   - **Why:** The reference image uses green, but the Thorx site uses orange as the primary accent. This gives the AI flexibility while maintaining brand consistency.

### 4. **Specified animation details**
   - **Added:** "Smooth 200-300ms transition when toggling"
   - **Why:** The reference image implies smooth animation. Specifying timing creates a polished, professional feel matching modern UI standards.

### 5. **Clarified "credits do not affect this process"**
   - **Before:** "The credits for each ad completion do not affect this process"
   - **After:** "Award credits for each completed ad (autoplay does not bypass credit distribution)"
   - **Why:** The original phrasing was confusing—it sounded like credits might NOT be awarded. Clarified that credits ARE awarded normally; autoplay just doesn't pause for credit distribution.

### 6. **Added dimension specifications**
   - **Added:** "40-48px width, 20-24px height for toggle track"
   - **Why:** Provides realistic sizing that matches standard toggle switches and the reference image proportions.

### 7. **Included border specifications**
   - **Added:** "Subtle gray border (1-2px) matching the reference image"
   - **Why:** The provided image shows a border on the toggle. This detail ensures visual accuracy.

### 8. **Balanced theme adherence with reference image**
   - **Before:** "must using Thorx core color schemes"
   - **After:** Specific guidance to use Thorx colors while matching the reference design style
   - **Why:** The reference image shows a green toggle, but Thorx uses orange. Provided guidance to prioritize brand colors while maintaining the toggle's visual style.

### 9. **Added accessibility considerations**
   - **Added:** "Ensure adequate contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)"
   - **Why:** Toggles need sufficient contrast for users with visual impairments. This ensures the implementation is inclusive.

### 10. **Improved edge case descriptions**
   - **Added:** Specific user notification requirements and state management details
   - **Why:** Makes the feature more robust and user-friendly by defining exact behavior for failure scenarios.

### 11. **Made testing checklist more visual-focused**
   - **Added:** "Green active state matches reference image design" and "Visual design matches provided reference image"
   - **Why:** Emphasizes the importance of matching the provided design reference, not just implementing any toggle.

This rewritten prompt gives your AI assistant both the functional requirements AND the visual design specifications from your reference image, ensuring the implementation matches your exact vision while maintaining Thorx's brand standards.
