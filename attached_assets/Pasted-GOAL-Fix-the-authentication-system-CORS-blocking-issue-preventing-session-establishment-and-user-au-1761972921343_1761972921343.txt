GOAL
Fix the authentication system CORS blocking issue preventing session establishment and user authentication on the Thorx platform.

PROBLEM ANALYSIS
Current state:

Server is blocking requests from http://127.0.0.1:5000 (console shows repeated "CORS blocked origin" errors)
Session exists but userId is undefined, causing 401 "Not authenticated" errors
Allowed origins only include localhost:5000 but browser makes requests from 127.0.0.1:5000
Session cookies cannot be set due to CORS mismatch
REQUIRED ACTIONS
Action 1: Update CORS Configuration
File: server/index.ts

Add 127.0.0.1:5000 variants to the allowed origins array to match the actual browser request origin.

Location: Lines 9-14 (allowedOrigins array)

Change:

const allowedOrigins = [
  'http://localhost:5000',
  'https://localhost:5000',
  'http://127.0.0.1:5000',
  'https://127.0.0.1:5000',
  ...(process.env.REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN ? [`https://${process.env.REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN}`] : []),
  ...(process.env.REPL_SLUG && process.env.REPL_OWNER ? [`https://${process.env.REPL_SLUG}.${process.env.REPL_OWNER}.repl.co`] : []),
];
Action 2: Verify Session User Check Logic
File: server/routes.ts

Ensure the /api/user endpoint properly handles session data and doesn't return 401 for valid sessions.

Location: Around line 6 of rag_source_6 (requireAuth middleware)

Verify: Session check logs show userId: undefined - investigate why userId isn't being set during login.

VALIDATION STEPS
Apply CORS fix and restart the development server
Clear browser cookies and cache (important for testing)
Test authentication flow:
Register a new user
Login with valid credentials
Verify session cookie is set (check browser DevTools → Application → Cookies)
Verify /api/user returns user data (200 status)
Refresh page and confirm user remains authenticated
Check console logs:
No more "CORS blocked origin" messages
Session check shows valid userId
Successful authentication responses
EXPECTED OUTCOME
CORS allows requests from 127.0.0.1:5000
Session cookies properly set with sameSite: 'none' and secure: true for Replit iframe environment
/api/user returns authenticated user data
Users stay logged in across page refreshes
All protected routes accessible with valid session
