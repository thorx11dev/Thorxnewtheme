Task: Perform an ultra-deep research & integration plan to identify the top 4 video ad networks suitable for our website and produce complete, copy-and-paste ready integration deliverables.

Requirements (hard constraints):
- Must support unlimited/large traffic (no restrictive traffic caps).
- Only requires standard registration/signup (no long-sales cycles).
- High payouts (explain payout model and realistic eCPM ranges).
- Easy to configure and integrate (provide concrete code examples).
- Comprehensive APIs and webhooks available (document endpoints & sample calls).
- Strong developer documentation and SDKs.
- No disallowed ad types: exclude networks that serve 18+, gambling/betting, extreme violence or otherwise illegal content.
- Provide terms & conditions/supply contract language (or link to T&Cs) suitable for embedding into our site.
- If applicable, prioritize networks that accept traffic and payout to Pakistan (state support clearly).

Deliverables (required for each of the top 4 networks):
1. Short summary card (1–2 lines): name, headline benefit, primary payout model.
2. Comparison table row with: business model (CPM/CPC/CPA/RevShare), estimated eCPM range, payment methods & minimums, countries supported (explicitly note Pakistan), traffic restrictions, key ad formats (outstream/instream/rewarded), SDKs/libraries, and links to docs/T&Cs.
3. Integration pack: step-by-step integration guide for web (vanilla JS) and common backends (Node/Express + PHP or one you detect from our repo), including:
   - required credentials and where to get them,
   - example init code and ad-rendering snippet,
   - example API calls and webhook handling (with sample JSON),
   - test workflow and debugging tips (how to simulate ad events/rewards),
   - secure handling of keys and payment callbacks.
4. Legal & content compliance: copyable T&C clause(s), content-filtering notes, and any publisher policy flags to watch for.
5. Risk & tradeoffs: limits, approval time, policy enforcement, ad quality concerns, and suggested mitigations.
6. Final verdict: rank (1–4) with a short justification and one recommended primary choice plus one backup.
7. Machine-friendly export: provide a JSON object containing key fields (name, payoutModel, eCPM_range, docs_url, supports_Pakistan: true/false, integration_snippets) and a one-paragraph executive summary suitable for emailing the CEO.
8. Sources: include credible links (documentation, pricing pages, developer docs, and T&Cs) with publication/last-updated dates.

If none fully meet all hard constraints, return:
- the best alternatives with clear tradeoffs,
- and a suggested combined approach (e.g., mediation/fallback, or using a high-eCPM primary + a fill network).

Formatting requirements:
- Provide a short executive summary (≤200 words) at the top.
- Provide the comparison table in Markdown for immediate paste.
- Include code blocks for all sample code and webhook JSON.
- Highlight any assumptions you made.

Output: single ZIP-able package structure (listed), plus the JSON and Markdown in the reply. Prioritize clarity and developer-ready specifics.
