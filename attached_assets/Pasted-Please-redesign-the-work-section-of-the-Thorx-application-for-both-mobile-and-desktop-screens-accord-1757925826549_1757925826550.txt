Please redesign the work section of the Thorx application for both mobile and desktop screens according to the following requirements, strictly maintaining the current Thorx Industrial theme and color schemes. Do not modify any other sections or pages outside the work section.

Design Guidelines
Use the existing Thorx color palette prominently: orange, black, and white for Key Metrics Cards and UI elements.

The background color of the work section should match the current Thorx pages’ theme to ensure a consistent look and feel.

Retain the Industrial design style that Thorx uses, ensuring the work section looks unique and aligns with the overall Thorx brand identity.

Section Layout
Include a clear, styled header at the top of the work section.

Below the header, display Key Metrics Cards colored in orange, black, and white to present key data visually.

Under the Key Metrics Cards, add four tabs horizontally arranged.

Tabs and Player Features
Each tab should contain one single video player with a large size.

The tabs’ UI/UX design should be similar to the registration and login tabs seen on Thorx’s authentication page, consistent in style and interaction.

The video player in each tab must have advanced features:

Autoplay video ads

Skip button

Minimize and maximize options

On desktop, the video player should resemble a YouTube-style player, minimalist but powerful, styled with Thorx’s Industrial theme colors and fonts.

On mobile, the video player should mimic the TikTok-style vertical video player, supporting scroll functionality through content within each tab.

The player design must be customized to reflect Thorx’s unique and advanced brand aesthetic without copying other common players exactly.

Additional Instructions
Leave all other pages and sections of Thorx unchanged.

Ensure responsive design for seamless use on desktop and mobile.

The final design must feel integrated into Thorx’s ecosystem, visually distinctive and highly functional.
