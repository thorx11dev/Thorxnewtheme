Here's an improved prompt for your Replit Advanced Assistant:

---

**Improved Prompt:**

"Redesign the pie chart on the User Portal Dashboard (Referrals page) to improve visual design and usability.

**Current issues:**
- No pie chart is currently visible in the provided screenshot
- If you're referring to a different chart/visualization, please specify its exact location

**Design requirements:**
1. **Visual style:**
   - Match the existing color scheme (orange #FF6B35, black #000000, beige #E8DCC4, white #FFFFFF)
   - Use the website's established border style (2-3px solid black borders)
   - Maintain consistency with current card designs

2. **Data visualization best practices:**
   - Clear labels with percentages
   - Readable legend or direct labeling
   - Sufficient contrast between segments
   - Maximum 5-6 segments for readability

3. **Layout:**
   - Responsive sizing (works on desktop and tablet)
   - Proper spacing within its container card
   - Follows the existing grid system

**Constraints:**
- Do NOT modify mobile layouts
- Use only existing CSS variables and color tokens
- Maintain current page structure

**Before implementing, please:**
1. Confirm which chart/data visualization you're referring to
2. Specify what data it should display (e.g., referral conversion rates, earnings breakdown, etc.)

If no pie chart currently exists, clarify whether you want to ADD a new pie chart or redesign an existing visualization."

## What I Changed and Why:

### 1. **Identified a critical ambiguity**
   - **Before:** Assumed a pie chart exists
   - **After:** Points out that no pie chart is visible in the screenshot
   - **Why:** The referrals page shows stat cards, leaderboards, and a referral code section—but no pie chart. This prevents the AI from implementing something that doesn't exist or modifying the wrong element.

### 2. **Removed vague directives**
   - **Before:** "more minimal and attractive and user friendly"
   - **After:** Specific design requirements with measurable criteria
   - **Why:** "Attractive" is subjective. Instead, I specified: match color scheme, use established borders, maintain consistency. These are actionable.

### 3. **Added concrete design specifications**
   - **Before:** "website theme design and standards"
   - **After:** Exact hex codes, border styles, and references to existing card designs
   - **Why:** "Theme" is too abstract. Referencing the actual colors visible in the screenshot (#FF6B35 orange, black borders) ensures consistency.

### 4. **Incorporated data visualization principles**
   - **Before:** Generic request for "user friendly"
   - **After:** Best practices like "Maximum 5-6 segments," "Clear labels with percentages," "Sufficient contrast"
   - **Why:** These are industry-standard UX guidelines for pie charts that actually improve usability, not just aesthetic preferences.

### 5. **Made it a two-step process**
   - **Before:** Direct implementation request
   - **After:** "Before implementing, please confirm..."
   - **Why:** Since the screenshot doesn't show a pie chart, the AI needs to either locate an existing one or clarify if this is a new feature request. This prevents wasted effort.

### 6. **Specified what data to visualize**
   - **Added:** Examples like "referral conversion rates, earnings breakdown"
   - **Why:** Pie charts need data. Without knowing what metrics to display, the AI can't create a meaningful visualization.

### 7. **Added technical constraints**
   - **Before:** Only mentioned not changing mobile
   - **After:** Added "Use only existing CSS variables," "Maintain current page structure"
   - **Why:** Prevents the AI from introducing new dependencies or breaking the existing component architecture.

### 8. **Maintained clear scope boundaries**
   - **Kept:** "Do NOT modify mobile layouts"
   - **Added:** "Responsive sizing (works on desktop and tablet)"
   - **Why:** Clarifies that while mobile shouldn't change, the design should still be responsive across larger screens.

### 9. **Structured for decision-making**
   - **Before:** Single instruction
   - **After:** Conditional logic: "If no pie chart exists, clarify whether you want to ADD..."
   - **Why:** Gives the AI clear paths forward depending on the actual state of the codebase.

This rewritten prompt acknowledges the uncertainty about what element needs modification, provides specific design criteria if a pie chart does exist, and requests clarification before any implementation—preventing the AI from making incorrect assumptions.
