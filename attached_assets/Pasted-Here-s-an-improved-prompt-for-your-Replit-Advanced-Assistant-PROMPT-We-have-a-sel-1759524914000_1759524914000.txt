Here's an improved prompt for your Replit Advanced Assistant:

---

**PROMPT:**

We have a self-hosted chatbot integrated into the Help section of our user portal. Currently, it has a **critical connection issue**: regardless of user input, it consistently returns the error message:

> "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting right now. Please try again or use the Contact section to reach our team."

**Your task:**

1. **Deep Analysis & Diagnosis**
   - Examine the chatbot's architecture, API endpoints, and network requests
   - Check server logs, browser console errors, and network tab in DevTools
   - Identify the root cause of the connection failure (backend, frontend, API keys, CORS, timeouts, etc.)
   - Test the chatbot across multiple devices and browsers (desktop, mobile, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

2. **Comprehensive Action Plan**
   - Create a detailed, prioritized task list to resolve the connection issue
   - Include specific code changes, configuration updates, or infrastructure fixes needed
   - Account for cross-device and cross-browser compatibility
   - Suggest testing protocols to verify the fix works across all platforms

**Deliverable:** A step-by-step troubleshooting report with actionable tasks, organized by priority and device/browser considerations.

## What I Changed and Why:

### 1. **Structure & Formatting**
- **Before:** Single run-on paragraph
- **After:** Clear sections with headers and bullet points
- **Why:** Makes it scannable and easier for the AI to parse distinct requirements

### 2. **Clarity & Precision**
- **Before:** "ultra deep analysis and testing and after understanding"
- **After:** "Deep Analysis & Diagnosis" with specific subtasks
- **Why:** Vague modifiers like "ultra deep" don't help the AI. Specific actions (check logs, examine APIs) do.

### 3. **Problem Statement**
- **Before:** Buried in the middle with unclear phrasing
- **After:** Front and center with the exact error message quoted
- **Why:** The AI needs to immediately understand the problem before being asked to solve it

### 4. **Actionable Tasks**
- **Before:** "make a comprehensive list of tasks to do to solve this problem"
- **After:** Explicit breakdown of analysis → diagnosis → action plan → testing
- **Why:** Guides the AI through a logical debugging workflow

### 5. **Technical Specificity**
- **Added:** Specific areas to investigate (CORS, API keys, timeouts, server logs, DevTools)
- **Why:** Directs the AI toward common chatbot failure points instead of generic troubleshooting

### 6. **Device/Browser Testing**
- **Before:** "across different devices" (vague)
- **After:** Explicit list of devices and browsers to test
- **Why:** Clear scope prevents the AI from overlooking important platforms

### 7. **Expected Output**
- **Added:** "Deliverable" section
- **Why:** Tells the AI exactly what format you want the response in

This prompt should give you much more targeted, actionable debugging assistance from your Replit AI.
