Here is a **clean, detailed, and Replit-agent-ready enhancement** of your prompt with clear design and behavior instructions:

---

## **Enhanced Prompt – Recreate Referral Component / Modal (Full-Screen)**

Recreate the **Referral component/modal** to match our **existing Loading Screen design standards** and overall brand style.

### **Design & Layout Requirements**

* The component must **cover the entire screen** (full viewport).
* Use a **solid black background**.
* Open and close with **smooth, premium animations** (fade + slide or scale).
* Maintain a **minimal, modern, and professional aesthetic** consistent with our UI system.

### **Content Placement**

* **Center of Screen:**

  * Display the **Referral Link** clearly and prominently.
* **Below the Referral Link:**

  * Show the **same social share icons currently used** (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.).
  * Icons must retain their **existing functionality**.
  * **Do NOT add a copy icon here**.
* **Right Edge of Screen:**

  * Place a **Copy icon** aligned vertically to the right side for copying the referral link.
* **Footer (Bottom End of Screen):**

  * Display bold text: **“Referral System”**
  * Text should be subtle but clearly visible, aligned with the loading screen typography.

### **Functional Requirements**

* Referral link must be:

  * Clickable
  * Copyable via the copy icon
* Share icons must trigger correct platform sharing actions
* Smooth performance with no lag or layout shift
* Fully responsive for **mobile and desktop**

### **Quality Assurance**

* Match spacing, typography, animation speed, and transitions with the loading screen.
* Ensure no UI overlap, no broken states, and no performance issues.
* Component must be **production-ready and error-free**.

If you want, I can also convert this into:

* 🔹 an **ultra-compact version**
* 🔹 a **Figma-style design spec**
* 🔹 a **purely technical implementation brief**

Just tell me 👍
