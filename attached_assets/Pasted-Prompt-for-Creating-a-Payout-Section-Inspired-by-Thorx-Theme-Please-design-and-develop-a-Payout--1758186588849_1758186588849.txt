Prompt for Creating a Payout Section Inspired by Thorx Theme

Please design and develop a "Payout" section for our platform, drawing heavy inspiration from the design language, theme, and UI/UX principles used in the Thorx Landing page, Authentication page, and User Portal page. The goal is to create a seamless, modern, professional, and highly user-friendly payout experience that aligns visually and functionally with Thorx’s distinctive style.

Design and Theme Guidelines:
Color Palette: Use a dark theme base featuring blacks and greys with contrasting accent colors (such as bright blues or oranges) to highlight actionable elements and important information.

Typography: Employ clean, modern sans-serif fonts to ensure readability and clarity, emphasizing hierarchy with font weights and sizes.

Visual Style: Modern, minimalistic, and tech-oriented with a balance of whitespace for clarity and focus. Use subtle animations or transitions to enhance interactivity without causing distraction.

Layout Style: Follow Thorx’s responsive, grid-based layout system with clearly segmented content areas for different functionalities. Ensure the section adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.

User Interface Elements: Incorporate buttons, input fields, tabs, and interactive toggles consistent with Thorx’s UI components, ensuring they are intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing.

Accessibility: High contrast ratios, clear labeling, and keyboard navigability.

Functional Components to Include:
Header Section:

Prominent title "PAYOUT" at the top.

Section sub-heading or prompt to "Enter Details" for payout processing.

Input Area:

Multiple input fields for users to enter payout details such as amount, recipient information.

Clearly labeled fields to avoid user confusion.

Payout Method Selection:

Distinct selection buttons or radio options for payout methods: Jazz Cash, Easypaisa, Bank Transfer.

Each method should have an icon or visual indicator.

Selecting a method should dynamically adjust the available input fields if necessary.

Summary and Final Statement Panel:

Display a "Final Statement" summarizing payout details, including:

Platform fee (e.g., 13%)

Direct referral fee (e.g., 15%)

Indirect referral fee (e.g., 7%)

Provide an area for recalculated totals dynamically based on input values.

History/Navigation Panel:

Sidebar or top section with a scrollable list of “History” entries showing previous payout transactions for quick reference.

Action Button:

A clear, large "Go!" button to confirm and initiate the payout process.

Button states should include default, hover, active, and disabled states.

Support Section:

A clearly labeled "Need Help?" or “Any Questions?” area linking to support resources such as FAQs, live chat, or contact forms.

Interaction & UX Considerations:
Inputs should validate user data in real-time and provide clear error messages.

Method selection adjusts available form fields dynamically.

The interface should provide feedback for submission status or errors.

Minimal page reloads or modal popups for seamless user flow.

Consistent spacing and alignment to maintain a clean and organized look.

This prompt encourages building a modern payout interface deeply inspired by Thorx’s consistent branding, UI design language, and user-centric experience as captured across their Landing, Auth, and User Portal pages. This will ensure the section feels integrated, professional, and engaging.
